### UKSRC GitOps Documentation

These guides are designed to walk you through the full deployment of SRCNet v0.1, from configuring & deploying a Kubernetes cluster in OpenStack through to deploying & maintaining each of the services and applications. As with any documentation these documents will evolve and may contain errata. If you find any such errata or missing steps, you should correct these through a peer reviewed merge request.
